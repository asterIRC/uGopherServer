	* Added opportunistic SSL - if a misinformed Gopher hits the SSL port plaintext, it will get a plaintext menu without the 100k convention.

	* yep, this is the big 1.0
	* S/Gopher proxy now in generic working order, and so is the server's SSL support. If you get any syslog cruft or worse, let me know.
	* I think it'll work now...
	* more to debug... fun

	* still doesn't notify of closure for CGIs, but eh
	* Should only do one thing now...
	* A bit of overkill here.... oh well, it's sorted out now I think.
	* well at least CGIs return now

	* Massively modified the overall structure; seems to be a pretty great piece of kit for a gopher server that wants inline maps.
